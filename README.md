Lakeview is a Python 3 library for creating publication-quality visualisations, in a style that visually resembles the [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). Lakeview is based on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

A quick example:

## Features

- **Clear figures**. Lakeview inherits the familiar and intuitive visual style of [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), with clear texts and symbols designed for publication and presentation. 
- **Programmable plotting**. Multiple files and genomic regions can be visualized automatically through a Pythonic interface inspired by [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- **Transparency and reproduciblity**. Figures are transparently defined in the code, eliminating the need for manual annotation.
- **Customizable layouts**. Lakeview supports many layouts implemented in [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), while allowing the user to define custom rules for ordering, groupping, and coloring each segment. Advanced customization is possible via the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) API.
